## 3. Challenging issues / Research and Solution / Result
This section demonstrates what were challenging issues, how to approach them, and how to solve them

### Challenge #1 - Defining a specification(function, verification) of the scree touch system
Since this project was the first new project in our business, there was not any guidance for the touch screen system

### Approach and Solution #1
**(Step 1)** Searched a lot of academic materials and technical documents relevant to the function and verification of the touch screen system<br>
**(Step 2)** Sorted out necessary information according to our project requirements<br>
**(Step 3)** Detailed all the functional elements of the touch screen system with functional safety requirements considered<br>
**(Step 4)** Finalized the specification with engineers of the cooperative company and our customers<br>
**(Step 5)** Verified functions of the touch screen system in a test laboratory with a robot arm machine based on the specification<br>

### Result #1
Stabilized the specficiation of the screen touch system and the verification process. the following presents the contents of the specification of the touch screen system.<br>

### Challenge #2 - Automating the time-consuming manual programming by inventing a software tool
There were too many kinds of graphic images (more than 100) according to vehicle options and regions. Whenever the images are changed by customer's request, the touch coordinates were changed manually at that time to match these graphic images with touch coordinates. It caused time-consuming works and software quality issues.

### Approach and Solution #2
**(Step 1)** Formulated the algorithm that calculates the touch areas and the coordinates according to the graphic images. In **fig.3)**, by simply placing a rectangular box on a graphic image, it calculates coordinates of a specific touch region (a red rectangular box). And then make a name of the touch region and copuy the calculated coordinates in the left table<br>
**(Step 2)** Designed the function that links data structure used in software program with information of the touch area. In **fig.2)**, 'Generate TC Coordinates' button performs the work that generates software programs in the form of *.h and *.c file<br>
**(Step 3)** Created the verification algorithm that checks overlapped touch areas, wrong connected data structure, and software program errors. In **fig.2)**, 'Linking coordinates To Option' button triggers the work that verifies the generated software programs and errors: overlapped touch areas, touch areas out of the range of entire graphic image, incorrectly connected data structure, invalid name of variables, duplicated name of the data used in software programs<br>
**(Step 4)** Programmed all the functions and algorithms by utilizing VBA (Visual Basic Application) programming, automating software code generation<br>

### Result #2
The solution #2 reduced the time spent on the manual programming works from a couple of days to 1 hours and improved the software quality<br>

### Challenge #3 - Inventing the software algorithm that compensates for erroneously aligned physical coordinates
To provide a reliable touch system at a final production stage, we decided to compensate for misalignment of the
physical coordinates due to incorrect attachment of the touch screen sensor on a TFT LCD.

### Approach and Solution #3
**(Step 1)** Designed the entire tuning process being employed in the final production stage<br>
**(Step 2)** Programmed the rotation matrix converting the misaligned physical coordinates into the normal ones<br>
**(Step 3)** Added service functions for production engineers to tune the parameters of the rotation matrix and to check the function of the touch screen sensor<br>
**(Step 4)** Educated production engineers about the tuning and verification method<br>

### Result #3
The solution #3 improved the yield of the mass production by reviving the TFT LCD having a bit misaligned touch screen sensor.

### Challenge #4 - Programming gesture algorithms
We needed to satisfy our customer requirements for gesture functions such as rotation, flicker and drag. Especially when implementing the algorithm of the rotary gesture, an object‚Äôs high moving speed and coordinate jitter caused several errors in calculating the total distance and direction (clock wise or counter clock wise) of an object.

### Approach and Solution #4
When calculating angle with C language, we can use an arctan(x) function in the math library. However, the usage of the arctan(x) will cause an delay in operation time of Microprocessors. In embedded system having limited resources, the time management of software tasks is very important. Thus, I introduced simple an equation that does not need to use the arctan(x)

**(Step 1)** Defined specifications of the several gestures including the moving speed of an object<br>
**(Step 2)** Designed the software modules of the gestures: logic flow chart, state machine, module dependency, data structure, tuning parameters<br>
**(Step 3)** Created the algorithm that calculates the angle of a current position of the rotary gesture in a defined graphic region by using coordinates, a center position, and quadrant<br>
**(Step 4)** Devised the algorithm detecting the rotation direction of an object by employing a rotation speed, a moving tendency, and a previous direction of it<br>
**(Step 5)** Programmed these algorithms and integrated them into software platfrom<br>

<strong>Fig.4) Quadrants and Coordinates in 2-dimentional plane</strong>
<p>

**Fig.4)** shows 4 quadrants, a circle (radius = 1), angles, center position, and random coordinates of the first quadrant. When a point moves from P3 through P1 to P2, ùúÉn value will decrease(ùúÉ3 -> ùúÉ1 -> ùúÉ2), Xn will increase(X3 -> X2-> X1) and Yn will decrease(Y3 -> Y2-> Y1) respectively. In this pattern, if we utlize a ratio of Xn and Yn according to ùúÉn, we can calculate ùúÉn.

<strong>Fig.5) the ratio property of Xn and Xy in the circle</strong>
<p>

**Fig.5)** shows the ratio property of Xn and Xy. It means that the ratio of Xn and Xy are going to change according to the variation of ùúÉn.

Now, we can calculate angle values as the following pseudocode.

>(float) function f32AngleCalcuation(Xn, Yn, Xo, Yo)<br>
>{<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(int) Delta_X; Delta_Y; Abs_X; Abs_Y;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(folat) Offset; CalTemp;<br>

>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Delta_X = Yn - Yo;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abs_X = Absolute(Delta_X);<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Delta_Y = Yn - Yo<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abs_Y = Absolute(Delta_Y);<br>

>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if(zero==(Abs_X + Abs_X))<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Offset = 0.0f; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;else<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Offset = (Delta_Y / (Abs_X + Abs_Y));<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>

>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if (Delta_X < 0)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CalTemp = 2.0f - Offset;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;else if (Delta_Y < 0)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CalTemp = 4.0f + Offset;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;else<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; //Nothing<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>

>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; return (CalTemp * 90.0f);<br>
}<br>

Let's compare return values of this equation and values of arctan(x).<br>
**EX.1)** Let's suppose that X=1 and Y=1. The return value of the above function is going to 45deg and arctan(1/2) value is going to 45deg.<br>
**EX.2)** Let's suppose that X=2 and Y=1. The return value of the above function is going to 30deg and arctan(1/2) value is going to 26.5deg.<br>
**EX.3)** Let's suppose that X=1 and Y=4. The return value of the above function is going to 72deg and arctan(4/1) value is going to 75.9deg.<br>

### Result #4
The value of arctan(x) is more accurate than the return value of this function. However, the tolerance of (arctan(x) - the return value of this function) is ¬±5deg or so. If a rotary gesture does not need very much accurate angle value, this approach will provide simple and fast operation. This solution saved memory capacity used for lookup-talbe of arctan(x).<br>
